\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary} We have presented a general hierarchical Bayesian method to estimate the probability distribution of population-level parameters and characteristics.
We have applied this framework for the luminosity distribution function of galaxies.
The method not only estimates the parameters of the luminosity function, but is also capable of recalibrating noisy observations.
Since the luminosities of galaxies are independent, the problem is massively parallelizable on the GPU.
Our implementation shows linear scaling with both, the number of Markov chain iterations and the number of objects, which makes it applicable to real data sets of size $10^{8}$.
We have made simplifications to the model that need to be mended when the method is used for real astronomical data, namely, correct cosmological distances have to be used.
Less trivial extensions to the model are folding in the spatial correlation of galaxies (large scale structure of the universe) and the distance--luminosity correlations (evolution of galaxy brightness).
