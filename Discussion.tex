\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

We have described a usefully general \Cpp\ framework for massively parallel implementation of simple hierarchical Bayesian models.
We have applied this framework to estimating luminosity functions of objects measured with uncertainty, and subject to (quantified) selection effects.
Our implementation shows linear scaling with both, the number of Markov chain iterations and the number of objects, which makes it applicable to real data sets of size up to $10^{8}$ using modest-sized clusters of GPUs.
